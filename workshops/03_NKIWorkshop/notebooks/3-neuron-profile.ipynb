    "In this tutorial, we use Neuron Profile to view the execution trace of a NKI kernel captured on a NeuronCore. In doing so, we learn about:\n",

    "- Installation and usage of Neuron Profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspecting a detailed execution timeline of compute engine instructions and DMA engine activities generated from your NKI kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As background, [Neuron Profile](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tools/neuron-sys-tools/neuron-profile-user-guide.html) is the tool you need to visualize where time is being spent during kernel execution on NeuronDevices, which is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks and opportunities of your kernel. Neuron Profile produces runtime execution data for every instruction executed on each compute engine and also every data movement activity completed by DMA engines. Neuron Profile also reports key performance metrics such as compute engine and memory bandwidth utilization, which allows developers to quickly find out the achieved hardware efficiency of their kernel. Profiling typically has near zero overhead thanks to the dedicated on-chip profiling hardware in NeuronDevices.\n",

    "### Install Neuron Profile\n",
    "Make sure you have the latest version of the `aws-neuronx-tools`, which includes updated profiling support for NKI kernels. Neuron Profile is included within this package and is installed to `/opt/aws/neuron/bin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `aws-neuronx-tools` package comes pre-installed on [Neuron DLAMIs](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/dlami/index.html). For detailed installation instructions see [Neuron Profile User Guide: Installation](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tools/neuron-sys-tools/neuron-profile-user-guide.html#installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profile using `neuron-profile capture`\n",
    "\n",
    "To profile a NKI kernel the required steps are (1) enable `NEURON_FRAMEWORK_DEBUG` to tell the compiler to save the `NEFF` file, (2) execute the NKI kernel to generate the `NEFF`, and (3) run `neuron-profile capture` to generate a `NTFF` profile. Each step is described in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will profile a NKI kernel which computes the element-wise exponential of an input tensor of any 2D shape. The rest of this tutorial will use a performance profile generated from this kernel as an example. Full code of `prof-kernel.py`:"
